The visible part of an HTML document is between `<body></body>`.

Headings are defined from `<h1></h1>` to `<h6></h6>`, with `<h1>` being the most important one.

- `<p>` is used for paragraphs.  
- `<pre>` is used if you want to display preformatted text.  
- `<hr>` is used for a horizontal rule (break line).  
- `<br>` is used for a line break.  
- `<a>` is used for links with the `href` attribute.  
- `<img>` is used to show an image, with attributes like `src` for the source file (which can be an absolute or relative path) and `alt` for displaying text if the image fails to load.

HTML elements can be nested and are not case-sensitive; for example, `<P>` is the same as `<p>`.

The `style` attribute can be used within HTML elements to add inline styles.

The `lang` attribute is used to declare the language of the webpage, such as `"en"` for first two characters and last two characters with a country code like `"en-US"`.
