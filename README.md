The visible part of an HTML document is between "<body></body>".

Headings are defined from h1> to h6>, with h1> being the most important one.

p is used for paragraphs.
pre> is used if you want to display preformatted text.
hr> is used for a horizontal rule (break line).
br> is used for a line break.
a> is used for links with the href attribute.
img> is used to show an image with attributes like src for the source file (which can be an absolute or relative path) and alt for displaying text if the image fails to load.
HTML elements can be nested and are not case-sensitive; P> is the same as p>.

The style attribute can be used within HTML elements to add inline styles.

The lang attribute is used to declare the language of the webpage, such as "en" or with a country code like "en-US".
